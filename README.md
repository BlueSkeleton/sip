Here we go again. I'm not the biggest (or even the smallest for that matter) p5.js fan, but I hope these following sketches prove to be something worthwhile.

## Ballz
The particle system one. It's nothing too fancy, the particles keep the same speed when they collide with the walls or ceilings, but when they collide with eachother a new vector is applied to them which is based on the speed they were travelling at and the angle at which they collided. Thought about putting in a little sound effect every time they hit, thought that would get annoying very fast.

## Sierpinski
The L-System one. I looked up the rules for the system, and gave each symbol its own meaning as an instruction to further the drawing of the triangle. It also moves up a step every time the space key is pressed. I haven't much to say about this one, I think it looks nice though.

## Flock
Got stumped trying to wrap my brain around flock and boid systems, but then I figured out a simpler way to accomplish pretty much the same task. I like to think that sometimes an imitation is just as good as the real thing.
