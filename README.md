Here we go again. I'm not the biggest (or even the smallest for that matter) p5.js fan, but I hope these following sketches prove to be something worthwhile.

## Ballz
The particle system one. It's nothing too fancy, the particles keep the same speed when they collide with the walls or ceilings, but when they collide with eachother a new vector is applied to them which is based on the speed they were travelling at and the angle at which they collided. Thought about putting in a little sound effect every time they hit, thought that would get annoying very fast.
